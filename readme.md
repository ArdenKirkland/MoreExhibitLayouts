Plugin for Omeka that adds custom layouts to Exhibit Builder 3.x. All layouts are somewhat responsive (galleries will be one item per row for smaller screens).

Adapted from NALLyouts plugin by Rachel Donahue (@sheepeeh on GitHub)

All layouts include an option of automatically including item metadata in the caption. 
	
**1-across**	A single file at full column width.

**2-across**	A layout for exactly 2 images across per block.

**3-across**	A gallery grid layout for exactly 3 images across per block.

**4-across**	A gallery grid layout for exactly 4 images across per block.

**5-across**	A gallery grid layout for exactly 5 images across per block.

**file-text-no-wrap**	A file to the left or right with a caption below and text on the opposite side, not wrapping under the file.
